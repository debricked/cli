    - errcheck #  Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases
    - gosimple # Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying code
    - govet # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
    - ineffassign # Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used
    - staticcheck # It's a set of rules from staticcheck. It's not the same thing as the staticcheck binary. The author of staticcheck doesn't support or approve the use of staticcheck as a library inside golangci-lint.

    - typecheck # Like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code
    - unused # Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types'
    - gofmt # Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default, this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification
    - godox # Tool for detection of FIXME, TODO and other comment keywords #
    - bodyclose # Checks whether HTTP response body is closed successfully
    - cyclop # Checks function and package cyclomatic complexity
    - dupl # Tool for code clone detection
    - gocognit # Computes and checks the cognitive complexity of functions
    - goconst # Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant
    - gosec # Inspects source code for security problems
    - nilerr # Finds the code that returns nil even if it checks that the error is not nil
    - nilnil # Checks that there is no simultaneous return of `nil` error and an invalid value
    - nlreturn # nlreturn checks for a new line before return and branch statements to increase code clarity
