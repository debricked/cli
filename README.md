## Installation
Check out the [releases](https://github.com/debricked/cli/releases/tag/release-v2) page. Choose the asset that is applicable for your system.
Below follow some common ways to install the CLI.
### Linux
```sh
curl -LsS https://github.com/debricked/cli/releases/download/release-v2/cli_linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar -xz debricked
```
```sh
./debricked
```
### Mac
```sh
curl -LsS https://github.com/debricked/cli/releases/download/release-v2/cli_macOS_arm64.tar.gz | tar -xz debricked
```
```sh
./debricked
```
### Windows
1. [Download zip](https://github.com/debricked/cli/releases/download/release-v2/cli_windows_x86_64.tar.gz)
2. Unpack zip
```sh
.\debricked
```
### Docker
```sh
docker pull debricked/cli:1-resolution-debian
```
## Scan
Once you've installed the CLI, you're ready to scan your project. You can scan a local project, or integrate a scanning mechanism in your CI/CD pipeline.
1. [Sign up to Debricked](https://debricked.com/app/en/register)
2. [Create an access token](https://docs.debricked.com/product/administration/generate-access-token)
3. `debricked scan -t <access-token>`

When the scan is complete, you will see the total number of vulnerabilities found and a list of automation rules that have been evaluated. Read more about automations [here](https://debricked.com/docs/automation/automation-overview.html#automation-overview).

### Docker
To make a scan directly through Docker based on your current working directory, you can use the following command:
```sh
docker run -v $(pwd):/root debricked/cli:1-resolution-debian debricked scan -t <access-token>
```

### CI/CD integration
If you would rather use `debricked` in your CI/CD pipelines, check out the [templates](examples/templates/README.md).
